# Mobile Flash Cards

This is the mobile flashcards project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course where you will build a native app. The app is a flash-card memory game where a user may create decks with cards, and test their memory skills. 

NOTE: Due to problems with setting up an Android emulator, this project has only been tested on an iOS device (iPhone 7 to be exact).

## Getting started

To get started running this project:
* Clone this project to a local directory
    - `cd ProjectReadable`

* Install and start app 
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn start`

You may then press `i` to launch the iOS emulator.
